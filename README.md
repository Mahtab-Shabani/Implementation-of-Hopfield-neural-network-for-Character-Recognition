# Implementation-of-Hopfield-neural-network-for-Character-Recognition

**Goal: Recognition of six first uppercase English letters by Hopfield neural network (even if they are noisy)**

**training set: the characters A, B, C, D, E, F, and Z**

**test set: noisy images**

üöÄ How to Run:
===========
### 1-     Open MATLAB.

### 2-     Run the main GUI file: 
```
hop
```
### 3-     In the GUI:


#### I. Click "Create Network" to initialize the network with training patterns.
#### II. Enter a test character (e.g., A, B, ..., Z) in the textbox.

#### III. Click "Add Noise" to corrupt the input pattern.(It's Optional) 
```
a = a + 0.1 * randn(size(a));
```

(This image is an example of the noisy given input ‚ÄúA‚Äù, the network attempts pattern recovery within a set number of steps, and the output at each step will be plotted in real-time, revealing the recovery process.)
